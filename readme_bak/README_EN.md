# LizzieYzy - GUI for Game of Go
![screenshot_en](/readme_bak/screenshot_en.png?raw=true)

LizzieYzy is a graphical interface modified from [Lizzie](https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie),allow loading various engines like: [Katago](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo)、[LeelaZero](https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero)、[Leela](https://github.com/gcp/Leela)、[ZenGTP](https://github.com/yzyray/ZenGTP)、[SAI](http://sai.unich.it)、[Pachi](https://github.com/pasky/pachi) or other GTP engines.

Add some new features on Lizzie's basis: **Hawk Eye, Flash Analyze, Batch Analyze, Estimate, Board Synchronization(only windows), Engine Game, Upload And Share, Double Engine Mode, Visualized KataGo Distributed Training** and ajust some details, support retina monitor, won't get fuzzy by scaled.
#
* New features

  * **Hawk Eye**: Get accuracy, winrate difference, score difference, blunder move based on the difference bettween engine candidates and actually move and displayed in chart.

  * **Flash Analyze**: Depend on Katago's analysis mode, analyze all kifus in parallel and get winrate graph candidates rapidly, support batch analyze.

  * **Batch Analyze**: Support batch analyze kifus by GTP engine or Katago's analysis mode.

  * **Estimate**: Use Katago(default)'s command:`kata-raw-nn or` ZenGTP's command `territory` to get raw territory, support automatically estimate after each move.	

  * **Board Synchronization(C#)**: [Repository](https://github.com/yzyray/readboard) Two mode: foreground(board can't be moved or covered)/backgorund, optimize for FoxWQ、TYGEM、SINA platform allow sync by click a button, when synchronizing from other platform or a picture or a movie you need to select the rigon of the board, support automatically carry moves for both sides(developed by C#, only support windows).

  * **Board Synchronization(Java)**: [Repository](https://github.com/yzyray/readboard_Boofcv) Foreground only, need select the rigon contains the board, support automatically carry moves for both sides.

  * **Engine Game**: Allow a game or multiple games bettween two engines, support load some SGF files as opening books, support various commands:`lz-analyze`, `kata-analyze`, `genmove` to get moves, multiple games will collect some statistics: elo, stdev interval and etc.

  * **Upload And Share**: [Repository](https://github.com/yzyray/LizziePlayer) Support upload kifu to [LizziePlayer](http://lizzieyzy.cn) and view on other device like cellphone or pad, LizziePlayer will display candidates, winrate graph, accuracy and support search blunder moves.

  * **Double Engine Mode**: Support load two engins and analyze synchronously, convenient for comparison.

  * **Visualized KataGo Distributed Training**: Visualized official KataGo training, all games(playing or completed) can be watched.
